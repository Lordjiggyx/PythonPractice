One to many

This is a parent child relationship to do this you often indicate the foreignkey variable in the child class and then create a relationship highlighting the name of the child class
it's not always needed but me personally i believe it is best to make everything bidrectional to do this use the back_ref attribute in the relationshp method

THE NAME USED IN BACKREF MUST MATCH THE NAME OF THE BIDERECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP VARIBALE IN THE CHILD/PARENT CLASS

deleting multiple related tables may be an issue

Like with hibernate, if you delete a parent object without specifying the cascade the child objects will not be deleted either

There are a number of cascades avalibale and theu can be delcared in the relationship method when mapping the class

save-update
merge
expunge
delete
delete-orphan
refresh-expire

The most common ones used together are the all and delete orphan which means that, if a parent class is defined it will delete all the child elements related
